# FitMix

## Description

_Please note_: this application is in Developer Mode with Spotify's API. Playlist generation will not work unless access is requested. If you'd like to test the app, please contact me at: jsnicholas @ pm.me

FitMix is a workout and playlist generator that helps you get motivated in the gym.

Technologies used: Spotify Music and oEmbed APIs, wger Workout API, Semantic UI CSS Framework, Javascript, HTML, and jQuery.

This is a fork from the original project, which aims to make the Spotify implementation more secure and further utilize the Semantic UI framework. The original code can be found here: https://github.com/gabrielarec/FitMix
